## Task

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r plotly, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

set.seed(123456)  

n = rep(1:100,2)
a = 0
b = 1
sigma2 = n^1.3
eps = rnorm(n,mean=0,sd=sqrt(sigma2))
y = a+b*n + eps
data = as.data.frame(n, y)

plot_ly(data,x = ~n, y = ~y) %>%
  layout(title = "Monte Carlo Simulation of Heteroscedasticity",
         xaxis = list(title = "Predictor"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Outome")
  )
```

## Criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

- Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

- Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
