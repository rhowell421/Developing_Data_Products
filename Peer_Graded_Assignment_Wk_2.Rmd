## Task

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r weather, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyr)

content <- paste(sep = "<br/>",
  "<b><a href='https://washington.org/'>Washington DC</a>"
)

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 4) %>%
  addWMSTiles(
    "http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/nexrad/n0r.cgi",
    layers = "nexrad-n0r-900913",
    options = WMSTileOptions(format = "image/png", transparent = TRUE),
    attribution = "Weather data Â© 2012 IEM Nexrad"
  ) %>%
  addPopups(lat = 38.895, lng = -77.0366, content,
    options = popupOptions(closeButton = FALSE)
  )

```

## Criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

- Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

- Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?
